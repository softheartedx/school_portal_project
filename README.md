# School Portal Project
<h3>Description</h3>
project collab with coding dojo cohort to make a school teacher/student portal. This application allows students and teachers to create their own profile in order to access their current school information. Students and teachers have access to an individualized dashboard upon registration or login, which they can view their classes, modify their class schedule, by enrolling in new classes, and update their user profile!
<h3>File overview</h3>
<h4>Student files:</h4>
When a user registers as a student, they have the ability to view their current class schedule and their general profile information. As a student, users have the ability to access the class catalog, populated by the teacher users. From this page, students can enroll in class, which will automatically be added to their class schedule on the dashboard page. From the dashboard, students also have the power to update and modify their own personal profile information, provided at time of registration.


<h4>Teacher files:</h4>
When a user registers as a teacher, their dashboard acts as more of an adminstrative role in regards to what they can modify or add to the portal. Teachers can also view their current class schedule and all other available classes that are being offered by other teachers or administrators. Teachers have the ability to add a new course to the course catalog from their dashboard, and that class will be visible immediately for enrollment. From the teacher dashboard, users can add classes, remove classes, and see individual classes with a single click. The one caviot with removing or deleting classes, is that teachers can only delete a class that does not have a roster. If a student is currently enrolled in a class, the teacher will not have the power to delete that class. 

<h4>Class & Enrollment files:</h4>
These files allow for students to view the entire course catalog and enroll in classes. Additionally, they allow users to update and modify their profile information, and modify class data (teacher). The files that allow users to view individual classes have code in there to build out what data is displayed about each class. Our plan is to continue building this application to include student grades for each course, a visible roster of students enrolled in each course, and a section where teachers or admin can post announcements to that specific roster of students.
